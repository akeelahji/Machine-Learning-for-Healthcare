Our analysis focus on constructing Machine Learning models to find important variables predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on the dataset National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2014 (NHANES). Based on this result, we ran Leision Analysis on Neutral Network to validate our results. Finally, we categorized data to see how lack of a certain category of data influences the prediction accuracy.
